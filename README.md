# WebDevComparison

**Comparison of different Web Development Stacks**

This project aims to compare various frontend technologies by implementing the **same three small applications** (World Clock, Timer, Countdown) using different tech stacks. This allows for a direct comparison of setup, complexity, developer experience, and performance.

## 🚀 Quick Start

To explore a specific implementation, navigate to its directory and follow the `README.md` instructions within that folder.
1.  **World Clock**: Display multiple timezones, add/remove clocks, highlight local time.
2.  **Timer**: Count up from zero, start/stop/reset, keyboard shortcuts.
3.  **Countdown**: Count down to a specific future time, visual notifications.

## 🏗️ Project Structure

The repository is organized by technology, with each folder containing a self-contained implementation:

```
/WebDevComparison
  /javascript        # Vanilla JS SPA
  /jquery            # jQuery SPA
  /typescript        # TS SPA
  /angular           # Angular SPA
  /react             # React SPA
  /nextjs            # Next.js App (SSR/RSC)
  /vue               # Vue SPA
  /react-native      # Mobile app (Expo)
  /backend           # Backend API (Node.js) [Placeholder]
  /database          # Database Schemas [Placeholder]
  /shared            # Shared resources (guidelines, schemas)
  SPECIFICATION.md   # Detailed project requirements and architecture
```

## Editor Setup

### Recommended Extensions
This project includes a `.vscode/extensions.json` file with recommended extensions for **VS Code**. When you open the project, you should be prompted to install them.

### Compatibility
- **Cursor**: Fully compatible with the VS Code extensions recommended.
- **Antigravity**: As an AI agent, I work directly with the codebase and do not require editor extensions.
- **Other Editors**: Most modern editors (e.g., WebStorm, Sublime Text) have plugins to support EditorConfig and TypeScript, but you may need to install them manually.
